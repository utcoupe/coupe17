These are the different orders exchanged between the Hokuyos and the AI.

Please make sure take a look at the "plan.svg" file (part Communication),
it's a summary of this part of the structure :
	- the Raspberry Pi is linked to the server/AI wirelessly
	- it hosts 2 programs :
		¤ main.js : always running nodeJS script, which starts the
			other when it is needed.
		¤ hokuyo : (compilation of the src files), connects to the Hokuyos,
			recieves the spots and sends the computed robots to the nodeJS.

"order"s between the AI and the nodeJS :
	
	{
		"to": "IA",
		"name": "position_tous_robots",
		"params": {"dots": [dots]}
	}
	
	{
		"to": "IA",
		"name": "nb_hokuyo",
		"params": {"nb": 0/1/2}
	}
	
	{
		"to": "hokuyo",
		"name": "start",
		"params": {
			"color": "yellow"/"green",
			"nbrobots": 2/3/4
		}
	}
	
	{
		"to": "hokuyo",
		"name": "stop",
		"params": {}
	}

	{
		"to": ???,
		"name": "C_started",
		"params": {}
	}

	{
		"to": ???,
		"name": "C_closed",
		"params": {}
	}


Datas (string lines on stdout) from the C to the nodeJS :
	
	"[HI:)] Hello !\n"
		Ok C started and able to communicate

	"[DATA]12,345#233,544#1223,43#234,0\n"
		Robots x,y separed with #

	"[INFO]%c\n"
		%c is the character of the info code :
			"2" : everything is ok !
			"1" : one hokuyo missing
			"0" : two hokuyos missing (Error : blind)
